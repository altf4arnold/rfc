Since the\r\noriginal RSVP-TE use case was defined, additional applications (e.g.,\r\nSegment Routing Policy and Loop-Free Alternates) that also make use\r\nof the link attribute advertisements have been defined. In cases\r\nwhere multiple applications wish to make use of these link\r\nattributes, the current advertisements do not support\r\napplication-specific values for a given attribute, nor do they\r\nsupport indication of which applications are using the advertised\r\nvalue for a given link. This document introduces new link attribute\r\nadvertisements that address both of these shortcomings.","pub_date":"January 1970","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":null,"errata_url":null}
